# MyReads

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you've read, currently reading, or want to read.  The user has the option to move a book from one shelf to another.  The search page allows the user to find a book to add to their shelf.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and the CSS was provided by Udacity.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your machine:
- clone the project with [`git clone https://github.com/jasmine-vo/react-project-myreads.git`]
- install the project dependencies with [`npm install`]
- start the server with [`npm start`]

## Note
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
